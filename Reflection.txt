    Doing practicals is the best way to help me get command of the skills learnt in the lectures. Remembering is not the purpose of studying
python, which means reciting the information given in lecture is far from using python proficiently. What I need to learn is the ability to look
for references properly and then solve the problems with my own logic.
    During the first few practicals, I find it easy to finish the task. However, since practical 11 where we should use recursion to complete 24
points, I have to ask many questions and browse through many webpage to look for help where I have to spend many times. The reason might 
be that as the complexity of the context mounting, it seems difficult for me to understand the knowledge well enough just after the lectures.
If I do the practice without reviewing the lecture first, it will waste me a lot of time. Therefore, it is suggested that I should have a fundamental
understanding of the lecture and then checkout my comprehension through trial and error.
    I find that abstract or logical thinking-pattern is difficult for me, for example those which are applied in 'recursion' and 'class'. From my
points of view, the only way to do solve this is to do more practices, keep patient and don't be afraid of trying.
