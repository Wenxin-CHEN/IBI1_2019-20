The problem I encountered
1.How can I revert(delete) all commits after a certain commit?
2.when I open the latest commit, I can only see the latest change I've made. 
If I want to know what the repository contains, I have to go through each step(commit) which seems inconvenient.
3.what is the difference between "checkout" and "revert".

I browesd through the website melanie mentioned in class and solved the problems
1."revert": 
will add a new step and  which is a reversion of chosen step, so the history of former step won't be changed. 
It is a security way of "undo".
2."checkout": 
1) checkout branch: transfer to chosen branch
2) checkout commit: HEAD which normal point to master will point to chosen commit.
3. "reset":
the undo history won't be saved, but I still not sure if reseting a step on GUI means the step is deleted.

I find the advantage of recording changes rather than the whole content after change is that we can revise any previous step 
without influencing the following step. It remind me of blockchain which is a reversion of this and it secure the unchangable
property of content.
