Are there places where there had more than 10000 total infections on March 31? If so, where are they?

start at line 61

I expected a list of locations where had a relative high number of  total infections according to the latest data on March 31.
The list agrees with my expectation and it can tell us which places were affected most seriously up to March 31.
I extracted the total number and data of each row respectively and judge if they are in agreement with my setting. If so, the row
would be presented with the only column of location.
